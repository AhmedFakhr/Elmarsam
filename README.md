A Mobile application using React native cross platform for art gallery selling and previewing paints and other art types.
i used an open source template and changed somethings on it to make it near to my goal 
the code that i used is from  https://github.com/Ahmadbkar/dribbble2react/tree/master/plant-app
so i'm thankfull to all of the team that worked on this code UI and UX designers i learned alot from this code â™¥ 
the application isn't complete yet i hope i will finish it some day 

the screens and the code flow i will put it in a presentation file 

all you need to do to run this code is 


first 
install npm at it's latest stable version
second
open command prompt 
type 
    "npm install yarn expo-cli -g" it will take a few moments to add the packages 
then 
    download the code 
    "go to the file using 'cd' commend "
then
    "yarn" it will install dependencies 
then type 
    "yarn start"
use expo application to preview the code on your mobile or in web
